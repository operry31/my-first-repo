# my-first-repo
A repository for learning GitHub.

I'm 18 years old, and currently a student at BRCC with a Guaranteed Admissions Contract to JMU for the Fall 2024 semester. My hobbies include programming, NFL/College Football analysis, F1, and drumming/percussion. My programming languages include Python (proficient) and C# (average), but I'm also learning Java for a college class, and I've dabbled in Swift and PHP.
